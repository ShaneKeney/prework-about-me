      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi!  I graduated from University of Connecticut with a degree in Computer Science.  I recently got a job as the Lead Mobile developer
        for Spikeball Inc.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Suffield, CT now living in Enfield, CT after graduation from Uconn.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Roundnet, Videogames, Programming.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>What I am doing right now! I've been lucky enough to find it two years out of school and plan to be with Spikeball for a very long time.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Enfield, CT.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am currently a Lead Mobile Developer and I am looking to both expand and supplement my current skills to dive into other projects for 
        the Spikeball.  As the sole developer, I will be responsible for all aspects of full stack development and as such want to cement my skills
        and learn new ones to ensure the best possible end product for our community!
